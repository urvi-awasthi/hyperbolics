# Implementation of Lorentz Embeddings

This repository provides an implemenation of Lorentz embeddings as described in "[Learning Continuous Hierarchies in the Lorentz Model of Hyperbolic Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03417)" (Nickel and Kiela, 2018). This is not an official implementation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.5
- PyTorch 0.4
